## Architecture Overview

The Public Health Intelligence Platform follows a modern three-tier architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and performance. The architecture separates concerns between data storage, business logic, and user interface, enabling independent development and deployment of each component.

### System Architecture

The platform consists of three primary layers: the presentation layer implemented as a React single-page application, the application layer built with Flask providing RESTful API services, and the data layer using SQLite for development with MySQL support for production environments. This separation enables horizontal scaling, technology flexibility, and clear separation of responsibilities.

The frontend React application communicates with the backend exclusively through HTTP REST API calls, ensuring loose coupling and enabling potential future development of mobile applications or alternative interfaces.
