## Next Steps for User

### Immediate Use
1. **Start server**: `python run.py` 
2. **Run tests**: `python test_app_with_data.py`
3. **Upload data**: Use web interface at http://localhost:5173
4. **Create forecasts**: ML models now work without data leakage

### Testing Scenarios
1. **Basic Upload**: Use `small_test_dataset.csv` (30 records)
2. **SEIR Modeling**: Use `covid_outbreak_seir.csv` (180 records)  
3. **Multi-location**: Use `multi_location_outbreak.csv` (600 records)
4. **Seasonal Analysis**: Use `seasonal_flu_2022_2023.csv` (243 records)
5. **JSON Format**: Use `outbreak_data.json` (90 records)
