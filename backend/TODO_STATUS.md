## Pending Tasks ðŸ“‹

### High Priority
- [ ] **Implement asynchronous file processing to prevent DoS attacks** (HIGH)
  - **Status**: Pending
  - **Description**: Currently file processing is synchronous. Need to implement background task processing for large files to prevent server blocking and potential DoS attacks.
  - **Impact**: Security and performance improvement
  - **Estimated effort**: Medium

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Add comprehensive input validation with parameter bounds** (MEDIUM)
  - **Status**: Pending  
  - **Description**: Basic validation exists but need parameter range validation for ML model parameters, SEIR parameters, and dataset constraints.
  - **Impact**: Data quality and security improvement
  - **Estimated effort**: Low-Medium

- [ ] **Implement memory usage limits and monitoring** (MEDIUM)
  - **Status**: Pending
  - **Description**: No memory limits currently enforced. Need memory monitoring and limits for large dataset processing.
  - **Impact**: Performance and stability improvement
  - **Estimated effort**: Medium
