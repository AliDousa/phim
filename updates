What to do now:
Stop your backend server (if it's running).
Replace the code in your local backend/src/main.py and backend/src/routes/datasets.py files with the new code provided above.
Restart your backend server (python src/main.py from within the backend directory).
Try uploading the mock data file from the Canvas again.
With these changes, the upload should now succeed, and you will see the new dataset appear in the table.
