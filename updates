What to do now:
Stop your backend server (if it's running).
Replace the code in your local backend/src/main.py and backend/src/routes/datasets.py files with the new code provided above.
Restart your backend server (python src/main.py from within the backend directory).
Try uploading the mock data file from the Canvas again.
With these changes, the upload should now succeed, and you will see the new dataset appear in the table.

1. Create a new SimulationManager.jsx component: This will be the main page for users to create new simulations and view the status of existing ones.

2. Enhance the VisualizationDashboard.jsx component: This will be updated to fetch and display the results of a selected simulation.

3. Update the main App.jsx: I will integrate the new components and add navigation to create a seamless user experience.


1. New File: frontend/src/components/SimulationManager.jsx
This file provides the UI for creating, viewing, and managing simulations. It dynamically displays parameter fields based on the selected model type.
